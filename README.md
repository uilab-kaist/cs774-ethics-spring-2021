## Course

The course consists of lectures and discussions.

### Special Lecture

Experts from around the world in AI and Ethics will give special virtual lectures.  
Most of the lectures will be moderated by the main lecturer (Alice Oh) in the form of questions and answers about the lecturersâ€™ publications.  
Because of the time difference, some lectures will be pre-recorded.  
<!-- Possible lecturers include [Joanna Bryson (Hertie School)](http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/) on the topic of general AI Ethics, [Shakir Mohamed (DeepMind)](https://shakirm.com/) on the topic of diversity and inclusion in AI, [Dirk Hovy(Bocconi University)](http://www.dirkhovy.com) on the topic of Predictive Bias in NLP, [Kyunghyun Cho (New York University)](https://kyunghyuncho.me/), and additional guests will be added. -->

### Reading

Students will read,  present,  and think about latest research from the reading list which is published in AI  and  ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL, CVPR, FAccT) related to ethical considerations.  
Readings may also include blog posts, articles in the media, online forum discussions, and publications from global governing bodies.

- Choose a paper related to the subject of the previous lecture from the [reading list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oL3aBkflgKoGymlpFqhx81fXZrKKOWh0lk2PfPTCdDU/edit?usp=sharing)
- Read the paper before the discussion and prepare some questions to be discussed

### Discussion

Students will lead peers to discuss the readings with thought-provoking questions.   
You will challenge the findings in the articles as to their accurate reporting and interpretation;  you will discuss relevance to the current time and various locales with different cultural backgrounds.  
You will present and discuss ideas for future research directions in AI and ethics.

- 12 in-class discussion (see schedule)
- Organize a group of 5~6 people, and have time to present what you read and discuss (you can use Korean if everyone is comfortable with Korean)
- All groups should submit their result at the end of class.
- See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs774-ethics-spring-2021/discussion)

### Team Projects

- Team project will be a major part of the class, especially during the second half
- Projects will be basically replication/modifications of recent research in bias in AI/ML
- More details will be described in the document below
- [https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs774-ethics-spring-2021/project](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs774-ethics-spring-2021/project)

## Evaluation(Subject to change)

 **If you actively and honestly participate in every discussion and do the project you will get at least B- (Project will be be a way to divide A+~B- in this case)**

* 10 In-Class Discussion : 50%

* Project : 50%
  
    **Note that any team may get up to -25%p for project score if there is a serious problem with teamwork.**
